## Technical Correlations

### Recipe-Building Mapping Logic
The analysis reveals that building requirements are embedded directly in recipe data:
- Each recipe specifies `building_requirement` field
- Building types are categorized by numeric IDs (20-27)
- Tier information determines building advancement level
- Skill requirements correlate with building tier requirements

### Building Type Classifications
- **Type 20**: Cooking Station
- **Type 21**: Smithing Station
- **Type 22**: Carpentry Station
- **Type 23**: Farming Station
- **Type 24**: Fishing Station
- **Type 25**: Scholar Station
- **Type 26**: Hunting Station
- **Type 27**: Mining Station

## Recommendations

### For Game Balance
1. **Scholar Station dominance**: Consider distributing some recipes to other building types
2. **Hunting Station utilization**: Expand recipes for better building value
3. **Tier progression**: Ensure meaningful progression across all building tiers

### For Player Experience
1. **Clear building requirements**: All recipes should indicate required buildings
2. **Skill-building alignment**: Ensure building tiers align with skill requirements
3. **Versatility balance**: Maintain usefulness across all building types

### For Data Structure
1. **Consistent mapping**: All recipes should have building requirement data
2. **Tier standardization**: Ensure consistent tier naming across all building types
3. **Skill correlation**: Strengthen skill-building requirement relationships

## Conclusion

The correlation analysis reveals a **well-structured crafting system** with clear building-recipe relationships. The **Scholar Station's dominance** (52.5% of building-required recipes) indicates its central role in the crafting ecosystem, while other buildings provide specialized functions. The **tier progression system** effectively scales recipe complexity with building advancement.

The **46.7% of recipes without building requirements** represent basic crafting that can be done anywhere, providing a good balance between accessibility and specialization.
